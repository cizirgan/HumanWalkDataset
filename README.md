# HumanWalkDataset
Data set with randomly created values to simulate human changing position. 

These datasets includes two directions: right and left.
The files are separated as training and test data.


## .NET Console Application 

The folder named Application includes the simple console app to create this data set. 
Note that the up and down directions are not optimized.

It is a .NET Core application but it does not have any dependencies except FileHelpers to create CSV files. That's why it can be used any .NET application
